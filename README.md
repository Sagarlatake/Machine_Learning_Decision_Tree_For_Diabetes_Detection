# Machine_Learning_Decision_Tree_For_Diabetes_Detection
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm Decision Tree for prediction of Diabetes Detection. Implementation includes the use of preprocessing techniques, LabelEncoding, feature scaling and then Built a model using Decision Tree for Prediction. Lastly a detailed clasification report is obtained on test data
